# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Changes Made

We've made the following changes to fix the Netlify deployment issue:

1. **Updated package.json**: Added a postbuild script to ensure the _redirects file is copied to the dist directory
   ```json
   "postbuild": "cp _redirects dist/_redirects || cp public/_redirects dist/_redirects || echo 'No _redirects file found!'"
   ```

2. **Updated vite.config.ts**: Explicitly set `copyPublicDir: true` to ensure public files are copied to the build output
   ```typescript
   build: {
     // ... existing options
     copyPublicDir: true,
   }
   ```

3. **Updated netlify.toml**: Modified the build command to run both build and postbuild scripts
   ```toml
   command = "npm run build && npm run postbuild"
   ```

## Deployment Instructions

Now that we've made these changes, you should:

1. **Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository**
   ```bash
   git add package.json vite.config.ts netlify.toml netlify-deployment-fix.md
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment 404 issue"
   git push
   ```

2. **Clear cache and redeploy on Netlify**
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to your site
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Clear cache and deploy site
   - Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

3. **Verify the deployment**
   - Once the deployment is complete, visit your Netlify site URL
   - Navigate to different routes directly (e.g., by typing them in the URL bar)
   - Refresh the page on these routes to ensure they still work

## How These Changes Fix the Issue

The main issue was likely that the _redirects file wasn't being properly included in the build output. The _redirects file is crucial for single-page applications (SPAs) like React to handle client-side routing on Netlify.

- The **postbuild script** ensures the _redirects file is explicitly copied to the dist directory
- The **copyPublicDir option** in vite.config.ts ensures that files in the public directory are copied to the build output
- The updated **netlify.toml build command** ensures that both the build and postbuild scripts are run during deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues after deploying:

1. **Check the Netlify build logs** for any errors
2. **Verify the _redirects file** is in the dist directory:
   - You can download the deployed site as a ZIP from Netlify to check
3. **Try a manual deployment**:
   - Run `npm run build && npm run postbuild` locally
   - Check that the _redirects file is in the dist directory
   - Deploy the dist directory manually to Netlify

## Future Considerations

To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always include a _redirects file in your public directory
2. Verify your build output locally before deploying
3. Consider adding a vite plugin specifically for handling SPA redirects
